                <p class="first">I want to reproduce a webpage I had designed in Freeway that has a 3 x 3 grid of images of DVDs and books that I am promoting. It also has a column on the right of that grid that contains links to essays elsewhere on the website and some general contact information. I have tried several approaches to duplicating this layout in Webflow including columns & div boxes. My problem is that the images get squeezed when the device is narrower. I don’t mind if the images get a bit smaller, but I want them to keep their original aspect ratio. (I’m not sure what the term is in Webflow lingo, but by aspect ratio I mean the proportion of width to height.) In one attempt I had images where one got skinny and the others kept their aspect ration and I couldn’t figure out why.</p>
                <p>There are a host of other issues aside from the one I described. I have only just started trying to use Webflow (because Muse is being discontinued). I designed a fairly complicated site in Muse, but what I need to do now is go back to this old website I designed in Freeway and turn it into a responsive one.</p>
